## API System and License Management

UVDM includes an optional API system for license verification and management. This is particularly useful for enterprise deployments or when you want to manage license distribution.

### Quick Start with API Server

1. Start the API server:
   ```sh
   python api_server.py
   ```

2. Generate a license (admin access):
   ```sh
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/license/generate \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"admin_key": "admin123", "license_type": "standard", "duration_days": 365}'
   ```

3. Use the License Manager in UVDM:
   - Launch UVDM
   - Go to Help > License Manager
   - Enter your license key and activate it

For detailed API documentation, see [docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md](docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md).

### Configuration

Edit `api_config.env` to configure the API server:

```env
UVDM_API_HOST=0.0.0.0
UVDM_API_PORT=5000
UVDM_ADMIN_KEY=your_secure_admin_key
UVDM_LICENSE_SERVER=http://localhost:5000
```

**Important**: Change the default admin key in production!

## Payment System (Multi-Provider Support)

UVDM now includes a comprehensive payment system that supports multiple payment providers including Stripe, PayPal, Wise, and Cryptocurrency payments. The system includes an admin interface for managing payment providers, webhook handlers for payment notifications, and a client-facing subscription page.

### Features

- **Multiple Payment Providers**: Support for Stripe, PayPal, Wise, and Cryptocurrency payments
- **Admin UI**: Comprehensive web-based admin interface for managing payment providers and webhooks
- **Webhook Support**: Secure webhook handling with signature verification for each provider
- **Database-backed Configuration**: SQLite database for storing provider credentials and webhook settings
- **Security**: Admin authentication, secret masking, and webhook signature verification
- **Test Mode**: Safe testing with mock payment sessions before going live

### Quick Start with Payment Server

1. **Start the payment-enabled API server**:
   ```sh
   python payment_api_server.py
   ```

2. **Initialize the payment database** (automatic on first run):
   ```sh
   python db/init_db.py
   ```

3. **Access the Admin UI**:
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000/admin/payments`
   - Default admin key is `admin123` (change this in production!)

4. **Configure Payment Providers**:
   - Click "Add Provider" or edit existing providers
   - Add your API keys and credentials
   - Enable the provider
   - Configure webhook settings for each provider

5. **Access Client Subscription Page**:
   - Open `http://localhost:5000/static/subscription.html`
   - Users can select payment methods and initiate payments

### Payment Provider Configuration

#### Stripe

1. Sign up at [https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. Get API keys from [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
3. In the admin UI, add provider with config:
   ```json
   {
     "api_key": "sk_test_...",
     "publishable_key": "pk_test_...",
     "test_mode": true
   }
   ```
4. Create webhook at [https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
5. Set webhook URL to `https://yourserver.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
6. Add webhook secret to webhook settings in admin UI

#### PayPal

1. Sign up at [https://developer.paypal.com](https://developer.paypal.com)
2. Create an app in the PayPal Developer Dashboard
3. Get Client ID and Secret from app settings
4. In the admin UI, add provider with config:
   ```json
   {
     "client_id": "your_client_id",
     "client_secret": "your_client_secret",
     "test_mode": true
   }
   ```

#### Wise (TransferWise)

1. Sign up at [https://wise.com](https://wise.com)
2. Generate API token from settings
3. In the admin UI, add provider with config:
   ```json
   {
     "api_token": "your_api_token",
     "test_mode": true
   }
   ```

#### Cryptocurrency

1. Set up cryptocurrency wallets (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.)
2. In the admin UI, add provider with config:
   ```json
   {
     "btc_address": "your_btc_address",
     "eth_address": "your_eth_address",
     "test_mode": true
   }
   ```

### Webhook Configuration

Webhooks allow payment providers to notify your server about payment events in real-time.

1. **Configure Webhook URL**: Set the webhook URL for each provider in the admin UI
   - Format: `https://yourserver.com/api/webhooks/{provider_key}`
   - Example: `https://yourserver.com/api/webhooks/stripe`

2. **Generate Webhook Secret**: Use the ðŸ”‘ button in the admin UI to generate a secure secret

3. **Enable Webhook**: Toggle the "Enabled" checkbox

4. **Test Webhook**: Use the "Test" button to send a test webhook to verify configuration

### API Endpoints

#### Admin Endpoints (require `X-Admin-Key` header)

- `GET /api/admin/payments` - List all payment providers
- `POST /api/admin/payments` - Create a new payment provider
- `PUT /api/admin/payments/:id` - Update a payment provider
- `DELETE /api/admin/payments/:id` - Delete a payment provider
- `GET /api/admin/payments/:id/webhooks` - List webhooks for a provider
- `POST /api/admin/payments/:id/webhooks` - Create webhook settings
- `PUT /api/admin/payments/:id/webhooks/:webhookId` - Update webhook settings
- `DELETE /api/admin/payments/:id/webhooks/:webhookId` - Delete webhook settings

#### Public Endpoints

- `POST /api/payments/:provider/create-session` - Create a payment session
- `POST /api/payments/:provider/confirm` - Confirm a payment
- `GET /api/payments/providers` - List enabled payment providers
- `POST /api/webhooks/:provider` - Receive webhook from payment provider

### Security Best Practices

1. **Set a Secure Admin Key**:
   ```sh
   export UVDM_ADMIN_KEY=$(python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))")
   ```

2. **Use HTTPS in Production**: Webhooks and API endpoints should use HTTPS

3. **Rotate Webhook Secrets Regularly**: Generate new secrets periodically

4. **Test Mode First**: Always test with test API keys before using production keys

5. **Monitor Webhook Logs**: Check server logs for webhook verification failures

6. **Restrict Admin Access**: Only expose admin endpoints to trusted networks

### Database Structure

The payment system uses SQLite with two main tables:

- **payment_providers**: Stores payment provider configurations
  - `id`, `provider_key`, `provider_name`, `config` (JSON), `enabled`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

- **webhook_settings**: Stores webhook configurations for each provider
  - `id`, `provider_id`, `webhook_url`, `webhook_secret`, `enabled`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

### Configuration Files

- `config/payments-db.example.json` - Database and provider configuration examples
- `db/migrations/20251019_create_payment_tables.sql` - Database schema migration

### Development Mode

By default, the system runs in development mode with:
- Default admin key `admin123` (shown with security warning)
- Mock payment sessions (no real charges)
- Test mode enabled for all providers

### Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Set secure environment variables:
   ```sh
   export UVDM_ADMIN_KEY="your_secure_random_key"
   export UVDM_API_HOST="0.0.0.0"
   export UVDM_API_PORT="5000"
   export UVDM_API_DEBUG="False"
   ```

2. Use a production WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn):
   ```sh
   pip install gunicorn
   gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 payment_api_server:app
   ```

3. Set up reverse proxy (nginx, Apache) with HTTPS

4. Replace test API keys with production keys

5. Enable webhooks with proper secrets
