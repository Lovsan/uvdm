   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/license/generate \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"admin_key": "admin123", "license_type": "standard", "duration_days": 365}'

3. Use the License Manager in UVDM:
   - Launch UVDM
   - Go to Help > License Manager
   - Enter your license key and activate it

For detailed API documentation, see [docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md](docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md).

### Configuration

```env
UVDM_API_HOST=0.0.0.0
UVDM_API_PORT=5000
UVDM_ADMIN_KEY=your_secure_admin_key

### Setting Up Payment Integration (For Administrators)

Payment integration requires configuration on the API server. Follow these steps:

#### 1. Configure Payment Keys

Create a `config/payments.json` file based on `config/payments.example.json`:

```bash
cp config/payments.example.json config/payments.json
```

Edit `config/payments.json` and add your API keys:

**For Stripe:**
```json
{
  "stripe": {
    "enabled": true,
    "publishable_key": "pk_live_YOUR_KEY",
    "secret_key": "sk_live_YOUR_KEY",
    "webhook_secret": "whsec_YOUR_SECRET"
  }
}
```

**For PayPal:**
```json
{
  "paypal": {
    "enabled": true,
    "mode": "live",
    "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    "secret": "YOUR_SECRET"
  }
}
```

#### 2. Set Environment Variables (Alternative)

You can also configure payments using environment variables:

```bash
# Stripe
export STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_YOUR_KEY
export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_YOUR_KEY
export STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_SECRET

# PayPal
export PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
export PAYPAL_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET
export PAYPAL_MODE=live  # or 'sandbox' for testing
```

#### 3. Create Products and Plans

**Stripe Setup:**
1. Log in to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com)
2. Create products: "UVDM Pro Monthly" and "UVDM Pro Yearly"
3. Create prices for each product
4. Copy the price IDs and add them to `config/payments.json`

**PayPal Setup:**
1. Log in to [PayPal Developer Dashboard](https://developer.paypal.com)
2. Create subscription plans
3. Copy the plan IDs and add them to `config/payments.json`

#### 4. Set Up Webhooks

**Stripe Webhooks:**
1. In Stripe Dashboard, go to Developers ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Select events: `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`
4. Copy the webhook signing secret to `config/payments.json`

**PayPal Webhooks:**
1. In PayPal Developer Dashboard, go to your app ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Add webhook URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/paypal`
3. Select events: `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.CREATED`, `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.UPDATED`, `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.CANCELLED`

#### 5. Restart the API Server

```bash
python api_server.py
```

### Testing Payment Integration

Use test mode before going live:

**Stripe Test Mode:**
- Use test API keys (pk_test_... and sk_test_...)
- Test with [Stripe test cards](https://stripe.com/docs/testing)

**PayPal Sandbox:**
- Set `"mode": "sandbox"` in config
- Use [PayPal Sandbox accounts](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api-basics/sandbox/)

### Payment Placeholder Mode

If payment credentials are not configured, UVDM operates in "placeholder mode":
- Payment buttons are visible but show configuration instructions when clicked
- Users see helpful setup messages
- No actual payment processing occurs
- Perfect for development and testing

## Video Preview & Trimming

UVDM includes built-in video preview and trimming capabilities powered by FFmpeg.

### Features

- Preview videos in your system's default media player
- Trim videos to specific start and end times
- Two trimming modes: Local (fast) and Server-side (for URLs)
- Visual time selection with second precision
- Progress indicators for trimming operations
- Save trimmed videos with custom names

### Using Video Preview & Trim

1. Download a video using UVDM
2. Navigate to "Download History" tab
3. Right-click on a downloaded video
4. Select "Preview & Trim" from the context menu
5. In the preview dialog:
   - Click "‚ñ∂ Play" to preview the full video
   - Set start and end times for trimming
   - Choose trimming mode (Local or Server-side)
   - Click "‚úÇÔ∏è Trim Video" to create the trimmed version
   - Save the trimmed video to your desired location

### Trimming Modes

**Local Mode (Recommended):**
- Requires: Downloaded video file and FFmpeg installed
- Pros: Fast processing, no server required, works offline
- Uses: FFmpeg with copy codec for quick trimming

**Server-side Mode:**
- Requires: API server with video processing configured
- Pros: Works with video URLs, no local FFmpeg needed
- Note: This is currently a placeholder - server implementation required

### FFmpeg Installation

Video trimming requires FFmpeg to be installed:

**Windows:**
```bash
# Using Chocolatey
choco install ffmpeg

# Or download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Linux:**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# Fedora
sudo dnf install ffmpeg

# Arch
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
```

Verify installation:
```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

### Server-side Trimming (For Administrators)

To enable server-side trimming, implement the `/api/trim` endpoint in `api_server.py`:

1. Install FFmpeg on the server
2. Set up video storage (local or cloud)
3. Implement video processing queue
4. Handle trim requests and return download URLs
5. Configure CDN or file server for video delivery

The endpoint specification is already defined in `api_server.py` as a placeholder.

**Important**: Change the default admin key in production!
